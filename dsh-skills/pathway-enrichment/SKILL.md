# Pathway Enrichment

## Overview

Enrichment analysis answers "what biology is over-represented in my genes?" It is the standard last step after differential expression, a screen, or clustering. There are two core methods, and choosing correctly is the single most important decision:

- **ORA (over-representation analysis)** — take a *thresholded* gene list (e.g., padj < 0.05) and test which gene sets it overlaps more than chance, using Fisher's exact / hypergeometric tests. Tools: Enrichr, g:Profiler.
- **GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis)** — take the *whole ranked list* of genes (no threshold) and test whether each gene set is concentrated toward the top or bottom. Preranked GSEA uses a per-gene score (e.g., the DESeq2 `stat`). Better when effects are broad and subtle.

This skill orchestrates these analyses, the gene-set databases behind them, and the interpretation pitfalls that make results wrong or unpublishable.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Find enriched GO terms / KEGG / Reactome / WikiPathways / MSigDB Hallmark sets in a gene list.
- Run GSEA / preranked GSEA on DESeq2, edgeR, limma, or Scanpy `rank_genes_groups` output.
- Score gene-set expression per sample/cell (ssGSEA, GSVA).
- Interpret, deduplicate, and visualize enrichment results, or build a publication table/figure.
- Decide between ORA and GSEA, pick gene-set libraries, choose a background, or fix gene-ID problems.

For quick one-off Enrichr lookups the `gget` skill (`gget enrichr`) is lighter weight; for raw pathway/interaction APIs (Reactome, KEGG, STRING) see the `database-lookup` skill. Use **this** skill for full, defensible enrichment workflows.

## Choosing the Right Method

| Situation | Method | Tool / entry point |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| You have a discrete hit list (DE genes, screen hits, cluster markers) | **ORA** | `gp.enrichr(...)` or g:Profiler |
| You have a full ranked list (every tested gene + a score) | **Preranked GSEA** | `gp.prerank(...)` |
| You have an expression matrix + class labels | **GSEA** | `gp.gsea(...)` |
| You want a gene-set score per sample/cell | **ssGSEA / GSVA** | `gp.ssgsea(...)`, `gp.gsva(...)` |
| You need a custom background or additional organisms | **ORA with custom domain** | g:Profiler (`domain_scope='custom'`) |
| You want TF / signaling *activity* (PROGENy, DoRothEA) | activity inference | see `references/databases-and-gene-sets.md` (decoupler) |

When in doubt: a thresholded list → ORA; a ranked table with scores → GSEA. Never threshold a list and then feed it to GSEA — that discards the ranking GSEA depends on.

## Setup

```bash
uv pip install gseapy==1.3.1 gprofiler-official==1.0.0 mygene==3.2.2 lxml
# gseapy pulls pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib. Network access is needed for
# Enrichr, g:Profiler, and MSigDB downloads. For fully offline ORA, use a local
# GMT file with gp.enrich() (see references/gseapy.md).
```

The examples target GSEApy 1.3.1 (released stable); the helper runs classic
permutation GSEA. Current MSigDB is 2026.1.Hs/2026.1.Mm. Local synthetic workflows
and small public mapping/catalog queries were executed; Enrichr submission
routes were verified from released source with mocked transport. BioMart returned
service-unavailable HTML during review; validate its output schema. See
[verified API contracts](references/verified-api.md) for evidence and boundaries.

Verify and list available gene-set libraries (names change over time — never hardcode blindly):

```python
import gseapy as gp
names = gp.get_library_name(organism="human")   # discover current Enrichr libraries
print([n for n in names if "Reactome" in n or "KEGG" in n or "Hallmark" in n])
```

## Quick Start

### ORA on a hit list (gseapy + Enrichr)

```python
import gseapy as gp

# Match the library organism and identifier namespace; map aliases explicitly.
# Keep original spelling: capitalization is not gene-ID or orthology mapping.
genes = [g.strip() for g in open("deg_symbols.txt") if g.strip()]
tested = [g.strip() for g in open("tested_symbols.txt") if g.strip()]
assert set(genes) <= set(tested)

enr = gp.enrichr(
    gene_list=genes,
    gene_sets=["MSigDB_Hallmark_2020", "GO_Biological_Process_2026",
               "KEGG_2026", "Reactome_Pathways_2024"],
    organism="human", background=tested,
    outdir=None,            # in-memory; set a path to also write tables/plots
)
res = enr.results
sig = res[res["Adjusted P-value"] < 0.05].sort_values("Adjusted P-value")
print(sig[["Gene_set", "Term", "Adjusted P-value", "Combined Score", "Genes"]].head(20))
# Speedrichr results omit Overlap; retain its actual response schema.
```

### Preranked GSEA from DESeq2 results

```python
import gseapy as gp
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

res = pd.read_csv("deseq2_results.csv", index_col=0)   # index = gene symbols
# Rank by the test statistic (sign = direction, magnitude = evidence). This is
# more stable than ranking by log2FoldChange, which is noisy for low-count genes.
rnk = res["stat"].dropna().sort_values(ascending=False, kind="stable")
rnk.index = rnk.index.str.strip()
assert rnk.index.is_unique, "Resolve duplicate mappings before ranking"
assert np.isfinite(rnk.to_numpy()).all()

pre = gp.prerank(
    rnk=rnk,
    gene_sets=["MSigDB_Hallmark_2020", "GO_Biological_Process_2026"],
    organism="human", method="permutation",
    min_size=15, max_size=500,        # size AFTER intersection with ranked genes
    permutation_num=1000, seed=123,   # seed = reproducible p-values
    threads=4, ascending=None, outdir=None,
)
out = pre.res2d.sort_values("FDR q-val")
print(out[["Term", "ES", "NES", "NOM p-val", "FDR q-val", "Lead_genes"]].head(20))
```

Use a **signed Wald statistic**, not the unsigned DESeq2 likelihood-ratio statistic.
If unavailable, `sign(log2FoldChange) * -log10(raw pvalue)` is a fallback: validate
p-values in [0, 1], bound numerical zeros (the helper uses 1e-300), and report ties
and exclusions. Do not use adjusted p-values or select only significant genes.

## Core Workflow

For a defensible analysis, work through these steps. The middle steps (ID type, background) are where results most often silently go wrong.

### Step 1 — Pin down inputs and pick the method
Confirm: which genes, what organism, is there a per-gene score (→ GSEA) or just a list (→ ORA), and what comparison they represent (direction matters for interpretation).

### Step 2 — Get gene IDs into the right namespace
Match the identifiers actually stored in the selected library: MSigDB offers symbol and Entrez GMTs. Human/mouse capitalization is a convention, not a conversion. Preserve original IDs, resolve one-to-many mappings deliberately, and map the ORA query and background identically. See `references/databases-and-gene-sets.md` for `gp.Biomart`, g:Profiler `g:Convert`, and `mygene`. A silent ID mismatch is the #1 cause of "nothing is significant".

### Step 3 — Choose gene-set libraries to match the question
Hallmark (broad themes) → GO:BP (mechanism) → KEGG/Reactome/WikiPathways (curated pathways) → C7 (immune), etc. Don't run 50 libraries; pick 2–4 that fit the biology. Catalog and selection guidance: `references/databases-and-gene-sets.md`.

### Step 4 — Set the background universe (ORA only)
The background must be the genes that *could* have been detected in your assay (e.g., all expressed/tested genes), not the whole genome. The wrong background biases significance. Every query gene must belong to that universe. GSEApy 1.3.1 uses Speedrichr for an explicit online background; local `gp.enrich()` + a pinned GMT gives a directly inspectable universe. g:Profiler also accepts `domain_scope='custom'` + `background`. Do not assume a background gene count or service default represents the assay. Rationale in `references/interpretation.md`.

### Step 5 — Run the analysis
Use the Quick Start patterns or the bundled `scripts/run_enrichment.py`. For GSEA always set a `seed` and report `permutation_num`.

### Step 6 — Filter on adjusted p-values
Use the correction returned by the selected method: Enrichr ORA reports BH-adjusted
p-values, g:Profiler defaults to g:SCS, and classic GSEA estimates `FDR q-val` from its
permutation distributions. GSEApy 1.3.1 `method="multilevel"` instead returns
BH-adjusted p-values across all tested terms and a `log2err` diagnostic. These are not interchangeable BH outputs. Report the
method and permutation type with the cutoff; GSEA's exploratory 0.25 convention
is for phenotype permutations, while its documentation recommends 0.05 for
gene-set permutations such as preranked analyses. Also inspect overlap and
gene-set size. See the [GSEA FAQ](https://docs.gsea-msigdb.org/GSEA/GSEA_FAQ/).

### Step 7 — Visualize
Dotplots, bar plots, enrichment maps, and GSEA running-score plots are built into gseapy (`gp.dotplot`, `gp.barplot`, `gp.enrichment_map`, `gp.gseaplot`). See `references/gseapy.md`.

### Step 8 — Reduce redundancy and interpret
GO especially returns many near-duplicate terms. Collapse with an enrichment map (term–term similarity), leading-edge overlap, or parent terms, and report representative terms. Interpretation framework and a publication-table format are in `references/interpretation.md`.

## Helper Script

`scripts/run_enrichment.py` runs ORA or GSEA end-to-end and writes a results table plus a dotplot, preserving gene-ID case, rejecting duplicate ranked genes, validating finite scores and custom backgrounds, and saving version/settings/input hashes in metadata JSON. Gene lists may be deduplicated; ranked genes must be resolved upstream. Only significant terms are plotted. Use a fresh output directory for each run.

```bash
# ORA from a hit list (one gene symbol per line)
python scripts/run_enrichment.py ora \
  --genes deg_symbols.txt --background tested_symbols.txt \
  --libraries MSigDB_Hallmark_2020 GO_Biological_Process_2026 KEGG_2026 \
  --organism human --outdir results/

# Preranked GSEA from a DESeq2 results CSV (auto-builds the rank from `stat`)
python scripts/run_enrichment.py gsea \
  --deseq2 deseq2_results.csv \
  --libraries MSigDB_Hallmark_2020 GO_Biological_Process_2026 \
  --organism human --outdir results/ --seed 123

# Preranked GSEA from an explicit 2-column rank file (gene,score)
python scripts/run_enrichment.py gsea --rnk ranked_genes.csv --outdir results/
```

For nonhuman runs, provide explicit `--libraries`; `--organism` selects the service
instance and does not convert genes or choose species-specific libraries. CSV/TSV
gene lists require headers; rank files accept comma/tab separators and an optional
`gene,score` header. Local GMT ORA requires `--background`.

Run `python scripts/run_enrichment.py --help` for all options (background file, FDR cutoff, min/max set size, permutations).

## Common Pitfalls

These cause most wrong or irreproducible results:

1. **Gene-ID / organism mismatch** — symbols vs Ensembl, human vs mouse genes. Map IDs and select a species-matched library, or matches silently drop to ~zero.
2. **Wrong background (ORA)** — using the whole genome instead of the tested/expressed gene set can bias significance. Set a custom background when it matters.
3. **Thresholding before GSEA** — GSEA needs the *full* ranked list; only ORA uses a cut list.
4. **Ranking GSEA by log2FoldChange alone** — unstable for low-count genes; prefer `stat` or `sign(LFC) * -log10(p)`.
5. **Multiple-testing across libraries** — Classic GSEApy permutation FDR is computed per library prefix; its multilevel method uses BH across the submitted family. Online/local ORA reports its own tested family. Report per-library FDR and stay conservative.
6. **Redundant GO terms** — don't report 40 variants of the same term; collapse and show representatives.
7. **Significance ≠ relevance** — check the overlap count and gene-set size; small overlaps can be unstable and large generic terms can be uninformative.
8. **Power and selection bias** — judge list size relative to the assay universe and term sizes, not universal cutoffs. RNA-seq gene length/detection biases and correlated genes can violate a simple random-hit model.
9. **No reproducibility metadata** — Enrichr/GO libraries are versioned and drift over time. Record library names+date and set a GSEA `seed`.
